This app was built by Splunk SMEs to provide suggested and best practice GDI (getting data in) configurations for OS Logs and Events from Windows Hosts for the Splunk Universal Forwarder.

Where possible, these configurations will be consulted during the design of new Splunk developed functionality such as IT Essentials - Learn procedures, IT Service Intelligence and IT Essentials - Work Content Packs, etc.

You should review all of the configurations within this app and determine if any adjustments should be made before being deployed to your environment based on your organizations needs and requirements. To reduce license consumption and reduce other resource usage, you may consider reducing collection interval rates or disabling specific inputs.
